## May 13, 2009 [sv1.0.38.34]

  * Added more phrases for Goofy to say in Goofy Speedway.


## June 27, 2013 [sv1.0.47.31]

  * Planning and hosting Toon Parties this summer just got easy as pie!
     * From now on, if you never actually start your Party, it will automatically cancel itself in your Toon Calendar 30 minutes after its scheduled start time. Your jellybean refund is then sent to your mailbox at your Toon Estate - without you having to do anything!

  * The Toon Calendar no longer shows past months, just the current calendar month and future months to make your Party planning even easier.
  * Also regular game and stability enhancements, including some holiday maintenance.
